        <h2>Description</h2>
        <h3>Appearance</h3>
        <p>Labradors are a medium-large breed, with males typically weighing 29–36 kg (65–80 lb) and females 25–32 <abbr title="kilograms">kg</abbr> (55–70 lb). The majority of the characteristics of this breed, with the exception of colour, are the result of breeding to produce a working retriever. </p>

        <p>As with some other breeds, the Conformation (typically "Show", "English" or "bench") and the Field (typically "Working" or "American") lines differ, although both lines are bred in both countries and the origins of both are from British lines. In general, however, Conformation Labradors tend to be bred as medium-sized dogs, shorter and stockier with fuller faces and a slightly calmer nature than their Field counterparts, which are often bred as taller, lighter-framed dogs, with slightly less broad faces and a slightly longer nose. However, Field Labradors should still be proportional and fit within American Kennel Club standards. With Field Labradors, excessively long noses, thin heads, long legs, and lanky frames are not considered standard. These two types are informal and not codified or standardised; no distinction is made by the AKC or other kennel clubs, but the two types come from different breeding lines. Australian stock also exists; though not seen in the West, they are common in Asia. These dogs are also very good with children. </p>
        <p>The breed tends to shed hair twice annually or regularly throughout the year in temperate climates.[5] Some Labradors shed considerably; however, individual Labradors vary.[11] Labrador hair is usually short and straight, and the tail is quite broad and strong. The webbed toes of the Labrador Retriever make them excellent swimmers. The webbing between their toes can also serve as a "snowshoe" in colder climates and keep snow from balling up between their toes—a condition that can be painful to other breeds with hair between the toes. Their interwoven coat is also relatively waterproof, providing more assistance for swimming. </p>

    <h4>Official Breed Standards</h4>
    <p>There is a great deal of variety among Labradors. The following characteristics are typical of the conformation show bred (bench-bred) lines of this breed in the United States and are based on the American Kennel Club standard.[10] Significant differences between U.K. and U.S. standards are noted. </p>

    <ul>
        <li><b>Size</b>: Labradors are a medium-large breed. They should be as long from the withers to the base of the tail as they are from the floor to the withers. The AKC standard includes an ideal weight for males of 29–36 kg (65–80 lb) and for females as 25–32 kg (55–70 lb).[10] The guidelines for height vary between the AKC, which gives 57 to 62 centimetres (22.5 to 24.5 in) for males and 55 to 60 centimetres (21.5 to 23.5 in) for females,[10] The Kennel Club which advises that males should be 56 to 57 centimetres (22 to 22.5 in) with females between 55 to 56 centimetres (21.5 to 22 in),[12] and the FCI which quotes a range of 56 to 57 centimetres (22 to 22.5 in) for males with females ideal at 54 to 56 centimetres (21.5 to 22 in).</li>
        <li><b>Coat</b>: The Labrador Retriever's coat should be short and dense, but not wiry. The coat is water-resistant, so the dog does not get cold when taking to water in the winter. That means that the dog naturally has a slightly dry, oily coat. Acceptable colours are black, yellow, and chocolate.</li>
        <li><b>Head</b>: The head should be broad with slightly pronounced eyebrows. The eyes should be kind and expressive. Appropriate eye colours are brown and hazel. The lining around the eyes should be black. The ears should hang close to the head and set slightly above the eyes.</li>
        <li><b>Jaws</b>: The jaws should be strong and powerful. The muzzle should be of medium length and should not be too tapered. The jaws should hang slightly and curve gracefully back.</li>
        <li><b>Body</b>: The body should have a powerful and muscular build.</li>
    </ul>
